# Aim of this document

This document (briefly) demonstrates how to use the _novelqualcodes_ package to visualise the novelty and richness of semi-structured interviews over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is _novelqualcodes_?

_novelqualcodes_ is a package aimed at qualitative researchers doing semi-structured interviews using the 'framework' method. Its main focus is to provide a transparent solution to reporting when refinements were made to questions during the interview process, and how that informs the researchers' decision to stop interviews (the _stopping point_). Its secondary focus is to allow researchers to visualise the novelty and richness of interviews as they are coded so that it can be part of the decision-making process regarding the stopping point.

_novelqualcodes_ does this by importing 'coding matrices' that are exported from _NVivo_'s **Matrix Coding Query** tool and tracking the trends of _novel_ and _duplicate_ codes across interviews. Briefly:

- A **novel code** is a topic/idea/concept that has not been mentioned in an interview before. For example, a novel code is a topic that was mentioned by Interviewee 17, but which was not mentioned by Interviewees 1 through 16.
- A **duplicate code** is one that has been talked about by other interviewees previously.

_novelqualcodes_ gets information about refinements by importing a spreadsheet of field notes where you have recorded when refinements were made, what was done, and why it was done. Code trends and refinements are displayed together in publication-ready plots.

The methodology behind this package is currently under review; this document will be updated when that paper is in press.



# Installing _novelqualcodes_

## Step 1. Install _R_

To run this package, you need to have the _R_ statistical programming language installed. You can download it from <https://cran.r-project.org/>; pick _Download R for {your platform}_ and follow the links to download an installer, and then run the installer.


## Step 2. Run an _R_ editor

_R_ comes with a simple editor called `RGui.exe`, located in the installation directory. If you want something a little easier to use that has more features, you can download and install _RStudio_ from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. 

Either way, start your chosen editor and you'll be greeted with the _R_ console. Basic information about how to use _R_ is outside the scope of this guided tour; ample resources exist on the internet.


## Step 3. Install _novelqualcodes_

You can install the package by running (i.e. type this in the console and hit _Enter_) the function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("novelqualcodes")
```

You only need to install the package once; you don't need to run this if you've installed it previously.


## Step 4. Attach the package to the session

Right now, the package is installed on your computer but has not been called up for use. To do so, run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(novelqualcodes)
```



# Input files used by the package

_novelqualcodes_ needs two kinds of input files from you: **field notes** and **coding matrices**.


## Field notes (of refinements)

This package accepts an Excel spreadsheet where you've recorded the refinements you've made to the interview process as you ran the study.

You can get a template of this spreadsheet by running the function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
create_field_notes_template("C:/path/to/save/this/to")
```

Or by creating a spreadsheet in Excel with these column names and saving it in Excel (.XLSX) format:

1. `interview_num` is the upcoming interview number where these refinements will take effect. At the time of writing, this is the only column that is used by the package; the rest is for your record-keeping.
2. `refinement_type` is free text where you can describe the kind of refinement you made, e.g. "add" or "rephrase" or "remove".
3. `refinement` is the actual text that has been changed.
4. `reason` describes the rationale behind the refinement.
5. `other` is for additional information you may want to include.


## Coding matrices

For our purposes, a coding matrix is an Excel spreadsheet where each row is a unique code, and each column shows how many times that code was mentioned in one interview. _NVivo_'s **Matrix Coding Query** tool can produce spreadsheets in the correct format, which we detail below.


### Getting coding matrices from _NVivo_

1. In _NVivo_, click **Explore** then **Matrix Coding Query**. A new pane will open with two large boxes: one labelled _Rows_ and the other labelled _Columns_.

![](nvivo01.jpg)

2. Click the **+** button under the _Rows_ box and select all **Codes**.

![](nvivo02.jpg)

3. Click the **+** button under the _Columns_ box and select only one **case** (participant/interview).
    - This package requires that there must be only one case per coding matrix. This is because we expect users to export coding matrices as the study progresses.

![](nvivo03.jpg)

4. Click **Run Query**. The coding matrix will be generated.
    - You _do not_ need to remove rows with a count of 0 (a code that was not mentioned by the interviewee). They will be ignored by _novelqualcodes_.

![](nvivo04.jpg)

5. Right-click the matrix that was just created and select **Export Coding Matrix**.

![](nvivo05.jpg)

6. Give it a filename that starts with the interview's sequence number or datetime (in YYYY-MM-DD HHMM format).
    - _Filenames are important!_ They are used to sort interviews chronologically to decide which codes are novel (not mentioned in previous interviews) and which are not. The two examples below will sort correctly.
    - Example 1 (interview number): `Int006_P12` for the 6th interview you conducted in the study, belonging to participant ID 12.
    - Example 2 (datetime): `2023-07-14 1355 P56` for an interview you conducted on 2023-07-14 at 13:55, with participant ID 56.
7. Save the file as a Microsoft Excel (.XLSX or .XLS) spreadsheet.

![](nvivo06.jpg)

8. Put all of your exported coding matrices in the same folder, and **separate from the field notes**.

# A worked example of an analysis with _novelqualcodes_

## File structure

Imagine that you are interested in public perceptions of insects. You've interviewed 15 people, you've made a few refinements, and you want to see how things are going. You have exported coding matrices for the 15 interviews from _NVivo_ and put them into **C:/insect_study/matrices/**. You also have a field notes spreadsheet, located at **C:/insect_study/records/refinements.xlsx**. So your file structure looks like this: 

```
C:/
----insect_study/
    +---matrices/
    |       Int01_ID112.xlsx
    |       Int02_ID18.xlsx
    |       Int03_ID14.xlsx
    |       Int04_ID72.xlsx
    |       Int05_ID33.xlsx
    |       Int06_ID32.xlsx
    |       Int07_ID77.xlsx
    |       Int08_ID85.xlsx
    |       Int09_ID17.xlsx
    |       Int10_ID12.xlsx
    |       Int11_ID21.xlsx
    |       Int12_ID31.xlsx
    |       Int13_ID54.xlsx
    |       Int14_ID121.xlsx
    |       Int15_ID731.xlsx
    |
    +---records/
            refinements.xlsx
```

Your refinements spreadsheet looks like this:

```
interview_num	refinement_type	refinement			reason					other
6				add				Can you tell...		Understand publi...	
9				add				Why don't yo...		Get participants...	
13				add				Is that how ... 	feel about most ...	
```

And your matrices look generally like this (note that it is fine to have zeroes in this matrix; they will be removed automatically):

```
	                                                       A : Int14_ID121

17 : Sees insects as pests                                               0
18 : Sees only some insects as pests                                     0
```



## Step 0. Start R and load _novelqualcodes_

As detailed above in the section [Installing _novelqualcodes_](#installing-novelqualcodes), we'll start _R_ and install the package if we haven't done that yet. 

Now we'll load the package to make it ready to use:

```{r}
library(novelqualcodes)
```


## Step 1. Import field notes and interviews

First, let's import the field notes and name it `my_refinements` for later use:

```{r fake_import_fieldnotes, eval=FALSE}
my_refinements <- import_field_notes(path = "C:/insect_study/records/refinements.xlsx")
```
```{r real_import_fieldnotes, echo=FALSE}
# This is the chunk that actually imports the files that are included with the
# package. 
my_refinements <- 
    import_field_notes(system.file("insect_study/records/refinements.xlsx", 
                                   package = "novelqualcodes"))
```

Field notes are optional; if you do not have any field notes, then you can skip importing them.

Second, we can import all of the interviews in the _matrices/_ folder and name it `nvivo_matrices`:

```{r fake_import_mats, eval=FALSE}
nvivo_matrices <- import_coding_matrices(path = "C:/insect_study/matrices")

#> ( 1 / 15) Reading Int01_ID731.xlsx
#> ( 2 / 15) Reading Int02_ID121.xlsx
#> ( 3 / 15) Reading Int03_ID54.xlsx
#> ( 4 / 15) Reading Int04_ID31.xlsx
#> ( 5 / 15) Reading Int05_ID33.xlsx
#> ( 6 / 15) Reading Int06_ID12.xlsx
#> ( 7 / 15) Reading Int07_ID17.xlsx
#> ( 8 / 15) Reading Int08_ID85.xlsx
#> ( 9 / 15) Reading Int09_ID77.xlsx
#> (10 / 15) Reading Int10_ID32.xlsx
#> (11 / 15) Reading Int11_ID21.xlsx
#> (12 / 15) Reading Int12_ID72.xlsx
#> (13 / 15) Reading Int13_ID14.xlsx
#> (14 / 15) Reading Int14_ID18.xlsx
#> (15 / 15) Reading Int15_ID112.xlsx

#> 15 files were read.
```
```{r real_import_mats, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nvivo_matrices <- 
    import_coding_matrices(system.file("insect_study/matrices/", 
                                       package = "novelqualcodes"))
```

**Important note:** `import_coding_matrices()` imports **any and all** Excel spreadsheets that it finds in the folder. This is why you should keep your field notes and any other Excel spreadsheets in a different place to avoid errors!


## Step 2. Count novel and duplicate codes

With the coding matrices imported, _novelqualcodes_ now has enough information to score novel and duplicate codes. Let's do that now and name the result `code_results` for later use:

```{r}
code_results <- score_codes(nvivo_matrices)
```

Looking at the result, we get a count of how many codes were mentioned in each interview (`n_codes`), how many of those were not mentioned in previous interviews (`n_novel`), how many were previously mentioned (`n_duplicate`), and the proportion and cumulative sums of codes.

```{r}
print(code_results)
```


## Step 3. Plot the 'novelty' of interviews

In the most basic sense, the ongoing generation of novel codes shows that new information is being generated in the study. By showing novel codes in context with any refinements to the questions, it shows how that trend may have been affected by those refinements, and whether novel code generation is plateauing.

```{r}
plot_novelty(score_df = code_results, refinements = my_refinements)
```

For this (very small and brief) example dataset, we can see that the three refinements we made before interviews 6, 9, and 13 did not generate any new information in subsequent interviews.

In a real-world situation this might suggest that a) our refinements were not properly targeted, or b) we have generated enough information and it might be time to stop interviews. However, this chart alone should not be used to decide on a stopping point because it does not show the richness (i.e. detail, broadness) of individual interviews, which is the job of our next plot.

If you did not import any field notes in Step 1, then you can run this function without any refinements:

```{r}
plot_novelty(score_df = code_results)
```

Or if you know when you made refinements but don't want to make a field notes file, you can provide the interview numbers directly:

```{r}
plot_novelty(score_df = code_results, refinements = c(4, 8, 10))
```


### Saving a recent plot to a file

If we want to save the most recent plot to a 10 x 5 cm image for use in a paper, we can run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
save_last_plot(filename = "C:/insect_study/plots/novelty.png", 
               size = "10 x 5 cm", dpi = 300)
```


## Step 4. Plot the 'richness' of interviews

In a real semi-structured interview scenario, some interviews will touch on many different topics while others will be quite brief; we call this 'richness'.

```{r}
plot_richness(score_df = code_results, refinements = my_refinements)
```

Refinements are marked with stars at each bar. Comparing this richness plot to the previous novelty plot, we see that each interview mentions a similar number of codes (3 or 4 on average) and that none of the interviews after refinements produced any novel codes. This means that our lack of novel codes is probably not caused by an unluckly string of low-richness interviews, and supports the idea that our refinements are not properly targeted.

Again, if you did not import any field notes in Step 1 then you can run this function without any refinements:

```{r}
plot_richness(score_df = code_results)
```

Or if you know when you made refinements but don't want to make a field notes file, you can provide the interview numbers directly:

```{r}
plot_richness(score_df = code_results, refinements = c(4, 8, 10))
```


## Step 5. Getting help from _R_

_R_'s shortcut for help is `?{topic}`. Try running these in the Console if you want to know more about the functions we've just used:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?novelqualcodes

?import_field_notes
?import_coding_matrices
?score_codes
?plot_novelty
?plot_richness
```
