
#' Read exported NVivo Coding Matrices from a folder
#'
#' @description
#' Coding matrices are built inside NVivo's _Matrix Coding Query_ tool, with codes
#' as rows and one participant ("case") as column. These files should be exported as
#' Excel spreadsheets (XLS or XLSX format), which is the default for NVivo. There
#' must only be one participant per file.
#'
#' Filenames **must** reflect the chronological order of interviews when they are
#' sorted. You can do this by naming them in sequence like _"Interview 07 PID 2345"_,
#' or by including a YMD HM timestamp like _"2023-06-17 1345"_. Sorting is number-aware
#' and only uses the filename itself (i.e. file path is ignored during sorting).
#'
#' @param path (Character) Path to a folder that contains coding matrices
#'    exported from NVivo (_Explore_ then _Matrix Coding Query_ then _Export Coding Matrix_). All
#'    files with _.XLS_ or _.XLSX_ extensions will be imported.
#' @param recursive (Logical) If `TRUE`, also imports files inside subfolders of `path`.
#'
#' @return A list of dataframes.
#' @export
#'
#' @seealso [score_codes()], [import_field_notes()]
#'
#' @examples
#' # A folder of example coding matrices included with the package
#' path_to_matrices <- system.file("insect_study/matrices/", package = "novelqualcodes")
#' print(path_to_matrices)
#'
#' # A list of files in that folder
#' list.files(path_to_matrices)
#'
#' # Import them all at once
#' my_matrices <- import_coding_matrices(path_to_matrices)
#'
#' # Look inside the result; each entry of 'my_matrices' is an interview, listed
#' # in chronological order.
