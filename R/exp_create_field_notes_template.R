#'
#' @aliases create_fieldnotes_template
#'
#' @description
#' It is good practice to record when refinements were made, what was done, and
#' the reasons behind them. These "field notes" are used by this package to
#' annotate plots created by [plot_novelty()] and [plot_richness()], and they're
#' also requested by peer reviewers as part of the publication process.
#'
#' This template contains 5 columns (only the first one, `interview_num`,
#' is currently used by the package, but this is subject to change):
#'
#' 1. `interview_num` is the upcoming interview number where these refinements
#'    will take effect.
#' 2. `refinement_type` is free text describing the kind of refinement,
#'    e.g. "add" or "rephrase" or "remove".
#' 3. `refinement` is the actual text that has been changed.
#' 4. `reason` describes the rationale behind the refinement.
#' 5. `other` is for additional information you may want to include.
#'
#' @param path (Character) The path where the field notes template should
#'     be created.
#'
#' @return Invisibly returns the path to the template (Character). In an
#'     interactive session, also opens `path` in the system's file viewer.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples

#' # Create the template in a temporary directory.
#' create_field_notes_template(path = tempdir())

    # package, which is Java-based and may introduce some headaches because of
    # that requirement. Instead, I've pre-made a template in inst/template/ and
    # we simply copy that to wherever the user wants it.
